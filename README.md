# Zombinvasion
A 3D game prototype where you control a few zombies invading a city. The zombies surround your "Zombie Leader" and attack nearby targets.
Dead enemies can transform in new zombies for you. You also have a "rage" ability. 
The enemies are either citizens or soldiers with guns. Citizens flee to buildings you can destroy.

Inspired from older flash games with a similar concept in 2D, with set levels and objectives.
